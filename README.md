# Perceptron Algorithm Project

In this project, we implement the Perceptron algorithm from scratch to perform binary classification tasks.

## Overview

The Perceptron algorithm is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It learns to classify data points into two classes based on a set of features.

## Dataset

We utilized a labeled dataset for training and testing the Perceptron algorithm. The dataset is included in this repository but can be easily substituted with your own dataset.

## Implementation

Our implementation of the Perceptron algorithm is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `perceptron_algorithm.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for training the Perceptron model, making predictions, and evaluating its performance on the test dataset.

## Repository Structure
